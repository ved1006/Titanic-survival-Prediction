# Titanic-survival-Prediction
This project is all about predicting whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived or not based on details like age, gender, and passenger class.

I trained two different models â€“ Logistic Regression and Random Forest â€“ to analyze the data and give predictions. After building the ML model, I deployed it with Flask and hosted it on Render ðŸš€.

Basically, you enter the passenger details and BOOM âš¡ the app instantly tells you whether the person would have survived or not. Simple, fun, and a perfect mix of ML + Deployment.
